# Controlling the Snake

In order to enable the player to control the snake, we need to capture keyboard events. We can do this by listening to the `keydown` event from the document:

```
keyEvent(function (code) {
  if (code === 37) direction = 'left'
  else if (code === 38) direction = 'up'
  else if (code === 39) direction = 'right'
  else if (code === 40) direction = 'down'
})

function keyEvent(fn) {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {

     fn(e.keyCode)
    })
}
```

---

During the paint cycle, we need to grab the direction and repaint the screen accordingly.

First, we must locate the row and column of the head, which will be the first item of the snake array.

```

```

---

Next we need to confirm the snake is not touching a border.

```
if (
  head.x === -1 ||
  head.y === -1 ||
  head.x === w/size ||
  head.y === h/size
) {
  // reset game
  init()
  return
}
```

---

* If the direction equals `right`? Then we increment x (column) by 1
* If the direction equals `left`? we decrement the x (column) by 1
* If the direction equals `up`? Then we decrement y (row) by 1
* If the direction equals `down`? we increment the y (row) by 1

```
    if (direction === 'right') head.x = head.x + 1
    else if (direction === 'left') head.x = head.x - 1
    else if (direction === 'up') head.y = head.y - 1
    else if (direction === 'down') head.y = head.y + 1
    snake.unshift(head)
```

---

What if the snake lands on the same cell as the food?

- We need to eat it.

If the snake eats the food, we need to:

* grow the snake by 1 cell
* increment food count by 1

otherwise remove tail of the snake.

```

if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
 score = score + 1
 food = createFood()
} else {
 snake.pop()
}

```
