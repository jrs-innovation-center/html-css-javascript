# Assignment in Javascript

Assignment is the process of setting a reference to a value so that it can be
referenced in other parts of the program using the reference. When assigning a
value to a variable, over the course of the application the variable can reference
many different values or be modified to reference different values.

> Hint: If you want to write better code, try to only use variables when you have
no other option.

In this example, we are changing the variable from pointing to the value '0' to
the value '2'.

<div class="tonic">
<pre>
var myvariable = '0'
console.log(myvariable)
// assign myvariable to 2
myvariable = '2'
console.log(myvariable)
</pre>
</div>
