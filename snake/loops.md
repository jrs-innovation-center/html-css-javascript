# Loops in Javascript

Computers are very good about doing the same thing over and over and over. Using
a pattern called a loop, you can tell the computer to do a set of statements for
a given number of times. Most of the time you can use map, reduce or filter, but
there are some cases where it may make sense to do an imperative loop.

Here is an example of a loop that will print from one to ten.

<div class="tonic">
<pre>
for (var i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
</pre>
</div>

A `for` loop takes three statements as a part of its expression and then a block
of statements that are run over and over until the variable is set to a value
that causes the conditional statement of the expression to return false.

There are other loops available in JavaScript too, but we will only be using the `for` loop in this class.
