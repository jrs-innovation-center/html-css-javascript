# Figuring out the Score

Everytime the snake eats the food, we want to increment the score and show
the score.
To accomplish this we need to add the logic in the paint function to increment the
score whenever the snake eats the food:

```
if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
  score = score + 1
  food = createFood()
} else {
  snake.pop()
}
```

---

And, we need to add the display of the score:

```
paintCell(food)

// display score
ctx.fillText('Score: ' + score, 5, h - 5)

setTimeout(paint, 60)
```
