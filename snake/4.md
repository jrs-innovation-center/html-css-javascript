# Create Snake Food

Just like the snake we want to draw the food. For this we will build a `createFood` function.

---

This function will randomly generate a location for the food using Javascript's random number generator.

```
function random(min, max) {
  return Math.round(Math.random() * (max - min)/min )
}

function createFood () {
  return {
    x: random(size, w),
    y: random(size, h)
  }
}
```

---

In the init and paint functions we want to call the create food method:

```
function init () {
  ...
  food = createFood()
  ...
}
```

---

In the paint function we need to determine if the head of the snake is the same as the location of the food.
If so, then we want to randomly create another food cell.

```
var head = snake ? snake[0] : createSnake()[0]
if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
  food = createFood()
}
```
