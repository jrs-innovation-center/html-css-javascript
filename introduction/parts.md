# WebPage Anatomy

---

We are going to review the parts of a web page, this should be very redundant, but we must go through it.

---

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

---

The first line of the web page is the document type:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

---

From the second line down you have the following structure:

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

In the header you have the following elements:

* title
* meta
* link
* script
* style

---

In the body you can add any html element:
