# Building our Engine Functions #

In the exercise we want to build our calculator functions.  The calculator is
able to the following operators:

- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

In the previous project we did some simple exercises that consisted of building
functions to do basic math operations, we will use these functions in our calculator
app.

In the script tag after your button handlers we want to add the following functions:

> The `___` are indicators for you to `fill in the blank` - if you need help please
ask a friend, google, and then the instructor.


## add function

```
function add (a,b) {
  return ______
}
```

## subtract function

```
function subtract (a,b) {
  return ______
}
```

## multiply function

```
function multiply (a,b) {
  return ______
}
```

## divide function

```
function divide (a,b) {
  return ______
}
```

---

Now that we have declared our base operator functions we need to connect them
to the Calculator engine.

We need to do it for each operator.

```
Calculator.setOperator('+', add)
Calculator.setOperator('-', ___)
Calculator.setOperator('*', ___)
Calculator.setOperator('/', ___)
```

> The `___` are indicators for you to `fill in the blank` - if you need help please
ask a friend, google, and then the instructor.
