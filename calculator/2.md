# Capturing the Input #

In this step we want to capture the button clicks and add the right information to
the input box.

There are four types of input:

- When a number button is pressed we want to append the number to the input box
- When a operator button is pressed we want to append the operator to the input box
- When a `AC` button is pressed we want to clear the input box
- When a `=` button is pressed we want to run the Calculator.calculate function.

---

When you put the user input together, you may notice that for each button, we
added the onclick handler for each button, these onclick handers are calling
the following functions:

- press
- clearInput
- calcInput

---

Inside the script tag, we want to initialize a variable to the input box using
the document function `getElementById`

```
var input = document.getElementById('input')
```

## Exercises ##

In these exercises we are going to walk through the process of creating each function
handler.

The press function

```
// this function we want to append the value to the input value property
function press (value) {
  input.value = ____  + value
}
```

---

The clearInput Function

```
// this function we want to clear the input value property
function clearInput () {
  input.value = ___
}
```

---

The calcInput Function

```
// this function we want to call the Calculator Engine
function calcInput () {
  input.value = Calculator.calc(______)
}
```
