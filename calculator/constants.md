# Constants #

A constant is some data item that will not and cannot be changed in your program.

```
const ONE = 1
const HELLO = 'hello'
```

In these examples, I am creating a reference to the number 1 and the string of
characters 'hello' using tha names ONE and HELLO respectively. By setting these Constants,
I am able to reference this data without having to redefine it every time.

```
console.log(ONE)
console.log(HELLO)
```

This is very useful to declare your data in one location and reference it in
several functions.
