# Calculator Engine #

We will be building a webpage that works as a functioning calculator.

To provide the calculator functions we will be creating a javascript module or library.

Libraries allow us to group sets of functions together and attach them to
webpages. We can extend the library without having to change every web page that
uses it.

This concept of creating separate libraries of code that can be reused over and over
is fundamental to programming.
