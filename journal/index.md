# Online Journal

In this project we will create a very simple journal application.


You will be able to create stories in the journal then list all the stories. You will also be able to remove or delete stories from the journal,

The two new concepts that will be introduced are:

- Data stores and how to add and remove data from a data store. Being able to store data for later use is a very important part of programming.
- Building dynamic lists of data from a data store.
