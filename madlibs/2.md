# Build the form.

Now that we have our story in a template, we need to create the template
placeholders. We will then create an HTML form with an input box for each
of the placeholders.

```
const story = `
<p>
A shepherd-boy, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, "Wolf! Wolf!" and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains.
</p>
<p>
The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: "Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure destroyed the whole flock.
</p>
<p>
There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.
</p>
`
```

---

To add a placeholder in templates we use the `${ }` notation.

For example,

```
const data = {}
const story = `
<p>
A shepherd-boy, who watched a flock of ${data.pluralNoun1} near a ${data.noun}, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, "${data.exclamation}! ${data.exclamation}!" and when his neighbors came to help him, ${data.verb} at them for their pains.
</p>
<p>
The ${data.noun2}, however, did ${data.adverb} come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: "Pray, do come and help me; the ${data.noun2} is ${data.verb2} the ${data.pluralNoun1}"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The ${data.noun2}, having no cause of fear, at his leisure destroyed the whole ${data.pluralNoun1}.
</p>
<p>
There is no believing a liar, even when he ${data.verb} the ${data.noun}.
</p>
`
```

Go through the template and create a placeholder using the following hints:

* adjective - describes something (Green, Squishy, Cute)
* adverb - describes an action (Quickly, Carefully, Silently)
* noun - person place or thing (Car, House, Child.)
* plural noun - people places or things (Cars, Houses, Children.)
* verb - An action (Run, Jump, Swim)
* exclamation - (Wow!, Oh!, Yuck!)
* number
* color
* name

You can think of others too. Remember if you want to use the same placeholder in
multiple places, just name it the same in multiple places.

Now we need to move to the html page and replace our button with a form.

Each input element will use the name attribute to create the key of the form
and the placeholder attribute to describe the content.

```
<form onsubmit="return generate(event)">
  <div class="row">
    <input type="text" name="pluralNoun1" placeholder="plural noun" />
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <input type="text" name="noun" placeholder="noun" />
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <input type="text" name="exclamation" placeholder="exclamation" />
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <input type="text" name="verb" placeholder="verb" />
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <input type="text" name="adverb" placeholder="adverb" />
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <input type="text" name="verb" placeholder="verb" />
  </div>
  ...
  <button class="btn">Generate Story</button>
</form>
```

You want to create an input for each item in the template.

Lastly, we will connect the form to the template by using a helper library called
form-serialize.
