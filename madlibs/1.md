# Create the Story

## Add Style Libraries

In the `<head>` section:

Add the following style libraries

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://npmcdn.com/tachyons@4.1.0/css/tachyons.min.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://npmcdn.com/btns@1.1.0/css/btns.css"/>
```

## Add Article Container

In the `<body>` section:

Add the element that will hold the story contents.

```
<article id="output"></article>
```

## Create generate function

In the `javascript` section below the story template, we want to create a new
function named generate.

```
function generate (event) {

}
```

## Add Story

In the `javascript` section:

Lets create a our story:

I am going to use the `boy who cried wolf` as an example, but you should write
your own story, it can be, for example,  about something you learned today or a note to your
friend.

```
function generate() {
  const story = `
  <p>
  A shepherd-boy, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, "Wolf! Wolf!" and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: "Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.
  </p>
  <p>
  There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.
  </p>
  `
}
```

> Notice we used the `<p>` element for each paragraph, and we used a template
string and assigned it to the story constant.


In this function we want to call the `document.getElementById` function and connect
to the article output element.

```
function generate () {
  const story = `...`
  document.getElementById('output')
}
```

And assign the template string to the `innerHTML` property

```
function generate () {
  const story = `...`
  document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = story
}

```

## Lets confirm everything works.

In the console, call the generate function

```
generate()
```

If successful, you should see your story.
