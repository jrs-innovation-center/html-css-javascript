# Finding Elements on a Page

In order to work with a web page we need the avility to 'find' (or get a handle to) the elements on the page. The `getElementById` Javascript functions provides this capability.

The `getElementById` function returns a reference to a specific element (using the `id` attribute) on an HTML page.

## Example

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/jicepa/1/embed?html,js,output"> on jsbin.com</a>

## Exercise

* Apply the following paragraph to the div element with an id of `george`

> Curious George is the main protagonist of a series of popular children's books by the same name, written by Hans Augusto Rey and Margret Rey. The books feature a curious brown monkey named George, who is brought from his home in Africa by "The Man with The Yellow Hat" to live with him in a big city.
