# Creating HTML Forms

In HTML, there is a `form` element, this element can wrap a set of elements that
receive input and bundle them into one batch of data.

> Detailed documentation on this function is available at: <br>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms

A form element looks like this:

```
<form>
  ...
</form>
```

The form can either push data to the server using the `method` and `action`
attributes, or it can send data to a javascript function using a `onsubmit`
handler.

We will be using the `onsubmit` handler.
